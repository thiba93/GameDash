# Security Baseline

## RBAC
- Roles: `player`, `staff`, `admin`.
- Default role on register: `player`.
- Staff/admin routes must reject non-privileged roles.

## Authentication baseline
- Email + password (hashed, never stored plaintext).
- JWT access token + refresh token.
- Refresh token must be revocable server-side.
- Phase 1 runtime uses PBKDF2-SHA512 password hashes and HMAC-signed access tokens.
- Refresh token values are stored only as hashes and are rotated on refresh.

## Input and output safety
- Validate all payloads at controller boundary.
- Reject unknown fields where possible.
- Sanitize user-generated text before rendering in frontend.

## Audit logging requirements
Critical actions that must be logged:
- Auth: register, login, refresh, logout.
- Profile: player profile update.
- Account sanctions.
- MMR updates after match result.
- Economy transactions.
- Map publish/update and moderation actions.

Phase 2 runtime requirement:
- Match result submission must write one audit entry per participant MMR update.
- MMR audit metadata must include match id, mode, previous MMR, next MMR, delta, previous rank, and next rank.

## Secret and environment handling
- Never commit real secrets.
- Use `.env.example` as contract only.
- Keep JWT and DB secrets outside source control.

## Data and transport
- Use TLS in non-local environments.
- Enforce least privilege on DB credentials.
- Store timestamps in UTC.

## Threats considered for MVP
- Privilege escalation attempts.
- Broken access control.
- Replay or abuse of refresh token.
- Tampering with transaction endpoints.
- Abuse/spam on UGC endpoints.
