# Decision Log

## 2026-03-31
- Locked stack: Next.js (web) + NestJS (api).
- Locked workspace: pnpm + turborepo monorepo.
- Locked contracts strategy: OpenAPI first + shared TypeScript contracts package.
- Locked auth baseline: email/password + JWT access/refresh.
- Locked data baseline: PostgreSQL + Prisma + Redis.
- Locked realtime baseline: WebSocket namespaces with polling fallback.
- Locked target quality: MVP demo robuste.
- Locked CI posture for now: no CI in this phase.

- Phase 1 auth runtime uses in-memory storage until Prisma repositories are wired in a later persistence pass.
- Passwords are hashed with PBKDF2-SHA512, access tokens are HMAC-signed, and refresh tokens are hash-stored and revocable.
- Admin dashboard access is restricted to `staff` and `admin` roles through Nest guards.

- Phase 2 matchmaking/MMR runtime uses in-memory queues, matches, ratings, histories, and MMR audit entries until Prisma repositories are wired in a later persistence pass.
- Matchmaking creates a simulated match when two authenticated players join the same mode queue.
- MMR deltas are mode-specific for MVP: ranked (+32/-24), unranked (+10/-8), fun (+5/-4).
- Rank mapping is exposed as read-only configuration through the player API baseline.
- Phase 3 progression runtime uses in-memory account progression, level reward configuration, reward grants, and XP audit entries until Prisma repositories are wired in a later persistence pass.
- XP is awarded from accepted match results using mode base XP plus outcome bonus XP: ranked 120, unranked 90, fun 60, win 60, draw 40, loss 25.
- Account levels use cumulative XP thresholds; level-up rewards are granted once per player and reward code.
- Quests remain out of scope for Phase 3 and are documented as optional future scope.
- Phase 4 economy runtime uses in-memory wallets, store catalog, inventory, append-only transaction journal, and purchase audit entries until Prisma repositories are wired in a later persistence pass.
- MVP wallets are seeded with sandbox balances: 1000 soft currency and 20 hard currency.
- Payment is simulated by debiting the in-app wallet only; no real payment processor or external payment credential is required.
- Rejected purchases are journaled for auditability and do not mutate wallet or inventory state.
- Phase 5 UGC runtime uses in-memory maps, versions, votes, tests, favorites, derived stats, and publish/update audit entries until Prisma repositories are wired in a later persistence pass.
- Map popularity score is derived from vote score, completed tests, favorites, version count, and a small recency boost.
- Public map browsing hides hidden maps by default; explicit status filtering can retrieve a specific status for later staff-facing workflows.
- Moderation readiness is modeled with map status, review metadata, reports, and moderation events.
- Phase 6 backoffice runtime uses in-memory studio settings, moderation actions, moderation signals, and admin audit entries until Prisma repositories are wired in a later persistence pass.
- Studio settings cover matchmaking queue tuning, MMR deltas, and economy purchase/balance controls.
- Settings writes are admin-only; moderation actions are available to staff and admin.
- Moderation history is append-only in the runtime baseline.
- Phase 7 standardizes API error responses with request ids and records request/error metrics in memory for MVP observability.
- Phase 7 health output is the primary runtime diagnostic surface until a production log sink is introduced.
- Phase 7 keeps critical-flow integration coverage at service composition level while persistence remains in-memory.
- Phase 7 adds a `RuntimeEvent` schema target for future durable observability without wiring database writes yet.
- Phase 8 final delivery starts from `docs/final-delivery.md` and links technical, user, demo, runbook, and business viability material.
- Phase 8 keeps the MVP runtime scope unchanged: demonstrable in-memory services with OpenAPI and Prisma as production contract baselines.
- Phase 8 uses the mandatory validation suite as the final Go/No-Go criterion for the defense.
