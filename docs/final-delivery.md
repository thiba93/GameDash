# GameDash Final Delivery

## Purpose

This document is the entrypoint for the phase 8 delivery package. It links the technical, user, demo, and business material required for the final review.

## Delivery status

- Roadmap phase: Phase 8 - Livraison et soutenance.
- MVP state: demonstrable end-to-end baseline.
- Validation gate: build, lint, typecheck, tests, OpenAPI validation, and Prisma validation must be green before the demo.
- Runtime scope: in-memory MVP services backed by Prisma/OpenAPI contracts for the production persistence target.
